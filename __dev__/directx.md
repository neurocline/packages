Can we put the DirectX SDK into a package? This would be useful.

June 2010 SDK is located at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812).

As of Windows 8, the DirectX SDK is included in the Windows SDK but it would probably still be nice to break it out. See [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee663275(v=vs.85).aspx)
