# libgcrypt

Home page is [Libgcrypt](https://www.gnu.org/software/libgcrypt/). What looks like an semi-official
repo is at [gpg/libgcrypt](https://github.com/gpg/libgcrypt). There is an unofficial mirror (not up to date) at
[Distrotech/libgcrypt](https://github.com/Distrotech/libgcrypt).

This is LGPL. This depends on libgpg-error.

This might only build on Windows with MinGW. There is a separate project that builds with
Visual Studio: [ShiftMediaProject/libgcrypt](https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/libgcrypt).
