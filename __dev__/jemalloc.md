# jemalloc

Home page is [jemalloc](http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/). Github is [jemalloc/jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc).

- `git clone git@github.com:jemalloc/jemalloc.git`

Windows port at [shines77/jemalloc-win32](https://github.com/shines77/jemalloc-win32).

CMake instead of autoconf/make at [jemalloc/jemalloc-cmake](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc-cmake)

Some big projects have jemalloc as a dependency. The biggest I now about is [redis](antirez/redis), but searching on Github returns 190,000+ results looking in code, mostly C of course. And that includes [gitter-badger/OregonCore](https://github.com/gitter-badger/OregonCore), a World of Warcraft game server emulator.
