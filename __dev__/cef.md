# cef

Chromium Embedded Framework. Old Google code page at [chromiumembedded](https://code.google.com/archive/p/chromiumembedded/). Active project page at [Chromium Embedded Framework / cef](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef). This project is deemed too complex to just be a single Git repo. CEF switched from Gyp to Ninja recently.
