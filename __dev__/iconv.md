# iconv

Sigh. Sure. The project now appears to be on Savannah: [libiconv ](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/libiconv/). GNU project page at [GNU libiconv](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/). Also see [LibIconv for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm).

From a [winlibs/libiconv](https://github.com/winlibs/libiconv) project on Github:

Because iconv.exe is GPL licensed, the author has decided to drop support for building on msvc altogether, because building on newer compilers that require separate distributions of MS runtimes might cause gpl violations (you can simply point people to the runtime installers provided by microsoft and not include them with the programâ€¦but that's another story). However, libiconv is lgpl and does not have these restrictions, the versions on php.net are compiled with Microsoft compilers with a small patch to fix compiler warnings and errors.

So, maybe not. Note: [winlibs](https://github.com/winlibs) appears to be associated with the PHP project.
