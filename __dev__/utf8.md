# utf8

Home page is on Sourceforge at [UTF8-CPP: UTF-8 with C++ in a Portable Way](http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/), and source at [UTF-8 CPP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/utfcpp/).

This is a header-only package. Version 2.3.4 was released on 2013-02-17. This is used in the
Perl Text::Unicode module, I believe (or so the node Unidecode package claims).

Also see [UTF-8 With C++ in a Portable Way](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14637/UTF-With-C-in-a-Portable-Way) from the author.

## Other

LLVM code for UTF is here (old code put into LLVM, hence the C nature):
